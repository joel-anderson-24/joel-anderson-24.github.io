      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>This blog post is to describe to you the differences between "class" and "ID" tags that are used in HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is what web developers use to crate style on the webpages that they are developing. Two of the 
       easiest ways to create style on specfic text and images is to use classes and IDs.</p>
      <p>Classes and IDs are very similar in the way they are used and look but there are some subtle differences between them.
       For example you can add a class to as many different parts of the webpage and each part of a webpage can have as many classes 
       added to it as you would like. Whereas with an ID they must be unique within the page and you can only use one ID tag on a part 
       of the webpage. Now I will some you some examples of how classes and IDs work together to create styling for a website.</p>
      <p>Now the images that are below may look like absolute gibbierish to you and you might be thinking what am I even looking at, but 
        fear not as I will go through the images with you step-by-step explaining what it all means and how they work together.</p>
