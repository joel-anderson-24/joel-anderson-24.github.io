      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 1. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</p>
        <p> Since leaving home and moving in with my flatmates, I've become a lot more confident and accepted so
            it makes me more sure of myself. It allows me to be unashamedly me. 
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>2. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</p>
        <p>My main strength would be patience. I think this will be useful for my learning journey because I won't feel uncomfortable 
           if I were to take a while on a certain area, I wouldn't feel rushed or pressured either because I'm comfortable taking my 
           time and being patient to make sure things are done properly.</p> 
        <p>I'm also meticulous and I like to complete things step-by-step and properly, so I think it'll help me to not miss any study 
           material and to complete everything in the intended order without skipping ahead.  
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 3. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</p>
        <p> I think my main limitation would be my typing speed. This is because I broke my arm a few years ago and struggle to pronate. 
            So, I'm re-learning how to type and this has led to a slower typing speed than most I'm sure. It will simply slow me down, 
            but won't stop me from completing what I'm supposed to.  
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p>
        <p> I like to think it's a nice little community that we are learning in, so I know it's easy to reach out for help when and if 
          needed. My usual style would be to break the problem up into bite-sized pieces and gnaw away at them one-by-one so it isn't as 
          overwhelming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p> 5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
              Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you 
              would try now and why. </p>
          <p> I used to work as a picker packer and my main function was to either pick and pack orders or organise the stock we had. 
            This was the same for many other team members, but a lot of the time the team members got lazy and wouldn't put things back 
            in the right place. It took a few mix-ups for it to be sorted, but I brought it to my manager's attention without naming 
            names. It was quite effective, however another approach I tried was talking to some individual team members and found that 
            the main issue was that they genuinely didn't know where some parts went but didn't feel comfortable asking. It ended up 
            that labels were put on the shelves to make it easier for everyone. I think if I were to do it again, I'd skip talking to 
            the manager.
