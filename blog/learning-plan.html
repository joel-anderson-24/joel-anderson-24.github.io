      <div class="paragraph">
      <p> 1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
      <p> The same as what it was in the Sprint 2 learning plan below the ultimate goal is to make money doing something I enjoy. I'm a gamer through and through so my plan is to further develop my skills so that I can get into game development one day.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p>
      <p> These are also going to be very similar as below with some slight changes. My strengths would be my ability to go through the work thoroughly and properly the first time around so I don't usually need
        to revisit/don't usually miss anything out (though it does happen sometimes.) Another strength would be the fact that I haved enjoyed what we've done so far so am looking forward to gaining more knowledge through bootcamp.
        A weakness is definitely my typing speed. I broke my arm a few years back and the doctors didn't put the bone back in its correct place, leaving me unable to pronate so I've had to learn how to type all over again in a more ergonomic position. Although my typing speed has improved these last few weeks it still is slower than most.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> 3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>
      <p> I think it will defintely be the pair programming and working in team settings as I am a very 'keep to myself' person.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> 4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
      <p> Mostly the same as above I would like to see myself improve with working alongside others and in a team enviroment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
        <p> Mostly the same expectations has I had with the Facilitation team. Just always ready and willing to help and replying in a timely manner, along with being patient if it takes a bit more time to understand certain learning parts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
        <p> Not getting stuck on one problem too long before asking for help and falling behind and doing my best to be collaborative. </p>

      <p> 1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <p> The ultimate goal is to make money doing something I enjoy. I'm a gamer through and through so my plan is to further develop

      <p>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</p>
      <p> My strengths would be my ability to go through the work thoroughly and properly the first time around so I don't usually need
        to revisit/don't usually miss anything out (though it does happen sometimes.) Another strength would be the fact that I enjoy what
        we've been doing so far and I find that leaves me wanting to do more. 
        A weakness is definitely my typing speed. I broke my arm a few years back and the doctors didn't put the bone back in its correct place, leaving me unable to pronate so I've had to learn how to type all

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> 3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
      <p> I would like to see how I develop as we move along into more teamwork-type roles. I used to be quite reserved, so I would like 
        to learn how to communicate better to a team. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p>
      <p> I like to think it's a nice little community that we are learning in, so I know it's easy to reach out for help when and if 
        needed. My usual style would be to break the problem up into bite-sized pieces and gnaw away at them one-by-one so it isn't as 
        overwhelming.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
        <p> I would probably message the discord chats or reach out to a Facilitator as my first point of call, besides possibly asking 
          my home group or cohort. Most likely on discord as this is the channel everyone is available on. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</p>
        <p> Just always ready and willing to help and replying in a timely manner, which they already do. Probably sometimes dumbing it 
          down for us newbies though haha. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</p>
        <p> Nothing in particular besides a bi-monthly trip to Auckland to see my family, but this can be done on weekends.
