      <p> How I solved being stuck on a simple problem.</p>
      <p> While wrking through the 'Manipulating Objects' section I was working through the questions and they were coming back as passes which was great until I got to question 3 and it came back as a fail. I was sure I had put in the correct code and it should've been working and passing which made it even more frustrating that it had failed. instead of getting mad that it had failed I took a deep breath and started to re-read over the code I had just written to see if there was anything I had missed. Sure enough I quickly realised that I had put a word inside quotation marks when I wasn't supposed to and as soon as I removed them the test passed.

      <p>How I 'elegantly' solved a problem.</p>
      <p> While working through the 'JavaScript Olympics' I came across event 3 which was to remove the odd numbers from an array of numbers and have it return only even numbers. Now I thought this might be slightly difficult to do until I remembered that on a previous section I had been trying to find an answer to a different question and stumbled across a video explaining exactly how to remove odd numbers from an array. Back then I didn't think the video was very useful but now I knew it would be so I went back through my search history and found that exact video. I rewatched to refresh my memory of it and it was exactly what I needed to help me complete the event 3 question.

      <p> Different problem solving techniques and how I fell about them.</p>
      <p>
        Pseudocode - Is very good for when starting on big projects so that you have a list to follow so that you don't get overwhelmed althoughI sometimes forget to use it. 
        <br>
        Trying something - Is a technique that I use very often and can become frustrating at times but also satifying when it works. <br>
        Rubber ducky method - Not a technique I was very often as I get so into the work that I don't really think about talking out loud. 
        <br>
        Reading error messages - I have used this technique a few times and I find it very helpful because usually the error message will show you exactly where you've gone wrong so you know where to go to fix the problem. <br>
        Console.logging - I don't use this very often although I know I should use it more as it is similar to error messages and it quite helpful. 
        <br>
        Googling - Probably my most used technique of all as it is my absolute go to when I have a problem to deal with. <br>
        Asking your peers for help - One of my least used techniques as I do like to figure things out on my own as I think it helps me learn better. 
        <br>
        Asking coaches for help - Also one of my least used techniques for mostly the same reasons as above.
        <br>
        Improving your process with reflection - I'm not very good with this technique as when I finish one problem I feel more accomplished and want to start on the next one straight away.

      <p> The time I was reluctant to ask for help.</p>
      <p> A time I was reluctant to ask for help was the last event in the JavaScript Olympics as I had completed all the other questions on my own and really wanted to complete the whole module on my own as well.
