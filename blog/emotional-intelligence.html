        <p> 1. What is emotional intelligence?</p>
        <p> Emotional Intelligence (EI or EQ for Emotional Quotient) is being able to preceive, interpret, evaluate and use emotions while communicating with other and effectively and constructively ralating to others at the same time. There are 4 key components of Emotional Intelligence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="paragraph-li">Perceiving Emotions</li>
          <li class="paragraph-li">Reasoning Emotions</li>
          <li class="paragraph-li">Understanding Emotions</li>
          <li class="paragraph-li">Managing Emotions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Emontional Intelligence can be used in your daily life in many ways like being able to solve problems in ways that for everyone, being able to move on after making a mistake and being able to accept criticism and take responsibilty.

        <p>2. How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
        <p> EQ is different to IQ (Intelliegent Quotient) in some subtle ways even though the abbreveations are only 1 letter of difference. EQ refers to your social skills, emotional ability and how you connect with other people whereas IQ refers to cognitive and intellectual skills like your memory and knowledge. If you have a high EQ you're probably really good with connecting with people on an emotional level, having a lot of empathy for others and understanding peoples problems. If you have a high IQ you're probably really good at solving logical problems and have a vast knowledge of a vareity of things. These two things are not completely seperate though. You can have a high EQ and high IQ and that would be very good as they work together constantly like when trying to resolve a conflict, EQ would help you understand a person or persons perspectives and control emotional responses while your IQ would help determine a logical and effiecent way to solve the matter at hand.

        <p> 3. Why is EQ important?</p>
        <p> Emotional Intelligence is very important for living in day-to-day life. You may not even be aware that you are using EQ but never-the-less it is there and you are using it constantly. Without emotional intelligence we wouldn't be able to relate to our co-workers when they have a problem. We wouldn't be able to have empathy and love for our family members. We wouldn't even be able to love our pets in the way that all pet owners do. Without emotional intelligence this world wouldn't be what it is today. It would be a cold heartless world with nobody caring for anyone else excpet for themselves. That is why emotional intelligence is so important.
