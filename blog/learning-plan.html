      <p>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        The ultimate goal is to make money doing something I enjoy. I'm a gamer through and through so my plan is to further develop
        my skills so that I might get into game development one day. 
      </p>
      <p>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        My strengths would be my ability to go through the work thoroughly and properly the first time around so I don't usually need
        to revisit/don't usually miss anything out (though it does happen sometimes.) Another strength would be the fact that I enjoy what
        we've been doing so far and I find that leaves me wanting to do more. 
        A weakness is definitely my typing speed. I broke my arm a few years back, but I can't pronate so I've had to learn how to type all
        over again in a more ergonomic position. 
      </p>
      <p>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        I would like to see how I develop as we move along into more teamwork-type roles. I used to be quite reserved, so I would like 
        to learn how to communicate better to a team. 
      </p>
      <p>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        I like to think it's a nice little community that we are learning in, so I know it's easy to reach out for help when and if 
        needed. My usual style would be to break the problem up into bite-sized pieces and gnaw away at them one-by-one so it isn't as 
        overwhelming.</p>
        <p>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          I would probably message the discord chats or reach out to a Facilitator as my first point of call, besides possibly asking 
          my home group or cohort. Most likely on discord as this is the channel everyone is available on. 
          </p>
        <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
          Just always ready and willing to help and replying in a timely manner, which they already do. Probably sometimes dumbing it 
          down for us newbies though haha. </p>
        <p>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
          Nothing in particular besides a bi-monthly trip to Auckland to see my family, but this can be done on weekends.</p>

     <div class="paragraph">
       <p>So as you can see in above images there's three sections to how the webpage will look but they all work together to get the
          final output like you can see image the 3rd image which is a simple webpage which should look familar to you as its what we all
          use everyday. 
       </p>
       <p>The first image we can see is our CSS file, the second image is our HTML file and third image is of course the end result on 
          our web browser. In our CSS image we can see that in order to create a class we must start with a period symbol followed by 
          the name you wish to call the class, creating an ID is similar however you use a hashtag symbal followed by the name. Note that
          the names have hyphens and not spaces in the names as CSS and HTML recognise spaces as new words so we must use hyphens when creating names. After 
          you create the name you can put the rules that you want the class or ID to follow. Rules are just another way of saying what 
          the class or ID will do when added to the HTML file. After we have created the classes and IDs we then head over to our HTML 
          page to add them to whatever words or images we want to add them to. In this example I have made the words the same as what 
          classes and IDs I have added to them to make it easier to follow along. We can see in our CSS image that class 1 has a rule 
          of color green and as we have added that class to our words "This is class 1" we can see the words are no green. We can see next
          that class 2 has a rule of underline and because we added that class to our words "This is class 2" they now have a line under them. 
          As we go furhter down our CSS image we can see that ID 1 has the rule colour blue and ID 2 has the rule line-through and these both
          corospond on our webpage after we added them to our HTML file because "This is ID 1" is in the colour blue and "This is ID 2" 
          has a line through the words.
       </p>
       <p>Now you may be asking yourself "Why would I use ID tags when I can just create lots of different classes?" and you'd be asking a 
          very good question. There are a couple of reasons as to why you would want to use an ID instead of a class. The number 1 reason 
          in my opinion is because ID tags overwrite a class tag if they are conflicting. Now you may be thinking "What does that even mean?"
          I'm glad you asked because that brings me to the last two sentences in the web browser image. You can see that the sentence "This is
          class 1 and ID 2" is both green in color and has a line through the words. This is because the rule for class 1 and ID 2 do 
          NOT conflict with each other this is because one is "color" and the other is "text-decoration" as seen in the CSS file. Now if we
          take a look at the sentence "This is class 1 and ID 1" we can see it is only blue in color even though class 1 specifies green.
          This is because class 1 and ID 1 DO conflict with each other as they both have "color" rules and it is blue in color because if
          there is a conflict between a class and an ID tag the ID tag wins. The second reason you would use an ID tag instead of a class tag 
          is because an ID tag is used for very specific and distinct formating as you can only have one ID tag per element/paragraph. It will
          also over rule any class that has been added to an element if they are conflicting.
         </p>
       <p>In conclusion classes and ID tags are very similar but are also both unique in their own ways and provide different aspects of styling. 
          Classes provide flexiblilty and reuseablity when styling a webpage, while IDs are more specfifc and unique when providing style to
          a page, but by utilizing both correctly you can add some great style to whatever page you may be designing.
