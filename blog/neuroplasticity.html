        <p>Now neuroplasticity might seem like a big confusing word that you may only hear doctors using but it is quite easy to understand when it is explained to you. Neuroplasticity is simply the concept that your brain continues to expand and evolve throughout your entire lifecycle and never stops and by simply just thinking about doing an activity you are helping your brain become better at that activity. Understanding this concept can help in countless ways to benefit people in their learning ability because if you have the mindset that your brain is as big and full as it ever will be then you'll never explore and try to learn new things as you'll view it as a waste of time. You will also be more eager to learn because if you think about learning an activity not only will it condition your brain to want to do that activity it also helps your learning speed when you do  perform the activity.</p> 
        <p>There are some very simple and easy ways to increase your neuroplasticity and you may have been doing some without even realising it because I certainly was. You can play video games, learn a new language, exercise and even travelling helps increase your neuroplasticity. Now obviously these are only a few ways that can help but it is exciting to think that some things we may do on a daily basis can help increase our neuroplasticity and we haven't even been realising it. </p>
        <p>Here is a link I found helpful when doing research.--><a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain">LINK</a></p>

        <p>Growth mindset is something that everyone should have but not a lot of people do. It is the mindset that when you receive a difficult challenge that instead of being upset that you don't know the answer that you should be excited to learn the answer and have the belief that you have the ability to improve your knowledge and skills. It is something that everyone should have because if everyone didn't have a growth mindset then nobody would learn anything new and nobody would make new discoveries that could change the world. </p>
        <p>Something that surprised me throughout my discovery journey while researching growth mindset was that even kids in schools need to have this reenforced with them because some kids may not receive any praise for learning new skills or having new knowledge. Yes they may get a "good job" told to them but that isn't acknowledging that they have grown and made progress it is usually just telling them good job for getting an answer right, not expanding their knowledge. </p>
        <p>I will integrate this into my personal learning journey by not having a 'I can't do it' mentality when coming up to a challenging task and instead telling myself it's about learning a new skill and expanding my knowledge. </p>
        <p>Here is another link I found helpful when doing research.--><a target="_blank" href="https://www.understood.org/en/articles/growth-mindset  ">LINK</a></p>

        <p>I will incorporate both of these learnings into my learning plan by always thinking about getting better and thinking about practising as well as practising physically and by having a growth mindset myself and not getting discouraged when there is a big task ahead or when there is a question I don't know the answer to instead I will see it as something new I can learn and that I don't understand it quite yet but I will learn it.</p>
