      <div class="paragraph">
      <p> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>
      <p> 1. I've learnt that when I get frustrated at a problem it's possibly because I've been looking at it for too long and when I take a break and then come back to refocus on the problem it's much easier to solve than I thought.
      <br>
       2. That I can sometimes get easily distracted but when I use toggl track to keep track of my time and set myself certain breaks it's easier to stay focused.
      <br>
       3. That reflection on some subjects doesn't have to be very time confusing and can be very helpful in the future on different projects.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
      <p> So that we can connect with our collegues and those around us while working so that we don't seem emotionless and are able to work together seemlessly and easily as it is easier to get along with others.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
      <p>
        Nothing has really surprised throughout the core learning but it has been good to go through the core learning along with the tech learning.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
      <p> I would have to say that the most challenging aspect would have to be transferring my answers for these questions from my thoughts into proper paragraphs for the blog.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
        <p> I think that it is so that when students graduate from this program they not only have the programming skills to find a good job but also the people skills to find a good job as well and work with great people.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</p>
        <p> Not really as there wasn't a lot of wasted time on the core learning and I still had plenty of time to practise programming.
