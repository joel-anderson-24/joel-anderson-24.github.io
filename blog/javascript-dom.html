       <p>This blog post is to help you understand the scary world that is JavaScript. Now if you're like me when I first got into coding you may have heard about JavaScript but have no idea what it is or how it works. Do not worry though as throughout this blog post I will guide you through the basics of what JavaScript is and how it works together with HTML and CSS to create an awesome website.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</p>
           <p>Now I am a big fan of car analogies so in order to describe to you how JavaScript works together with HTML and CSS I'll relate it to how a car works. HTML is the framework of the car the part that adds structure and CSS is the panels and paint that adds style, now JavaScript is the engine of the car it's what makes the car move around and drive properly instead of it just sitting there for us to simply look at. JavaScript is what makes websites and code interactive with us as users. </p>

        <p>How 'control flows' and 'loops' work within JavaScript.</p>
          <p>You may be asking "what are control flows and loops?" And that is a very good question and I am going to do my best to break them down for you along with an example as well. The control flow as the name would suggest, how to flow of something is controlled, which isn't a very in depth description but we'll break that down more now. Now imagine you're building a house, you'd start off by building the foundations for the house, followed by the walls of the house, then you'd put on the roof, followed by painting the walls and then finally putting furniture in the house. That is a basic example of control flow because it is an order in which you do things so that they work together. Now what is a loop? Well a loop is how you tell JavaScript to complete the "control flow" it is a way of saying "Hey, here is the process to do things now do it." and it is also called a loop because you control how many times you want JavaScript to go through the process before stopping. The same way you wouldn't want to just build 1 house if you we're a building company you'd want to loop through the process as many times as you needed until all the houses were built. <br>

       <p>What is the DOM and how might you interact with it?</p>
       <p>The DOM is like the blueprint of the building that we have just constructed above, it provides a detailed structure representation of the webpage. The DOM allows JavaScript to interact and manipulate the content of HTML and CSS and change it directly on your webpage. In this screenshot of the DevAcademy website below you can see the left side of the screen is the website and the DOM is open on the right side. As an example if we wanted to change the words "Launch your tech career" we would paste this into the DOM "document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "Hello World"" and after pressing enter the website would then read "Hello World" instead of "Launch your tech career". This is just one simple way that we can interact with the DOM to change our files within the website.<br>

      <p>The difference between arrays and objects</p>
      <p>An array is in simple terms a list and we've actually already seen an array in an above example. Can you find it? It is in the picture for the control flows and loops example, the array is where is 'list' the process of building a house (foundations, walls, roof etc). If you were building a house and wanted to use an array you would lay it out as below. An object on the other hand is more like a database. For example instead of having a list you would lay it out as below for an object. So the difference between arrays and objects is simple an array is like a list of what materials you need to buy and an object is a database of what  the materials are and their features.<br>

      <p>What are functions and why are they helpful?</p>
      <p>Functions inside JavaScript come in all shapes and sizes and I'll list a few of them for you and to make things easier to follow we're going to pretend the JavaScript functions are like a timber factory. 

        <p>The 'function definition' is like the overall blueprint of the factory it outlines how a task should be performed like how the timber should be cut. </p>
        
        <p>The 'parameters' are like the workers in the factory, different workers will do different jobs inside the factory the same way different parameters will perform different tasks inside a function.</p>
        
       <p> The 'code' is like the machinery in the factory they carry out the actual work in the factory the same way the code executes the instructions that are defined in the function. </p>
        
       <p> The 'output' is the final product that you get out from the end of the factory in the same way that the return statement at the end of a function provides the output or the final result. </p>
        
       <p>The 'function call' is like calling the manager of the factory and saying you need some timber from them. If you didn't call them to let them know you needed the timber they wouldn't deliver any timber to you. The same way that if you don't 'call' the function after you create it in JavaScript it's not going to do anything other than sit there.</p>  
        
        <p>So a function in JavaScript is like a factory in the way that it has parts going into it, parts coming out and also you have to call it in order to make sure it's actually doing its work like you told it to.
