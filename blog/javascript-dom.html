       <p>This blog post is to help you understand the scary world that is JavaScript. Now if you're like me when I first got into coding you may have heard about JavaScript but have no idea what it is or how it works. Do not worry though as throughout this blog post I will guide you through the basics of what JavaScript is and how it works together with HTML and CSS to create an awesome website.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</p>
           <p>Now I am a big fan of car analogies so in order to describe to you how JavaScript works together with HTML and CSS I'll relate it to how a car works. HTML is the framework of the car the part that adds structure and CSS is the panels and paint that adds style, now JavaScript is the engine of the car it's what makes the car move around and drive properly instead of it just sitting there for us to simply look at. JavaScript is what makes websites and code interactive with us as users. </p>

       <div class="paragraph">
        <p>How 'control flows' and 'loops' work within JavaScript.</p>
          <p>You may be asking "what are control flows and loops?" And that is a very good question and I am going to do my best to break them down for you along with an example as well. The control flow as the name would suggest, how to flow of something is controlled, which isn't a very in depth description but we'll break that down more now. Now imagine you're building a house, you'd start off by building the foundations for the house, followed by the walls of the house, then you'd put on the roof, followed by painting the walls and then finally putting furniture in the house. That is a basic example of control flow because it is an order in which you do things so that they work together. Now what is a loop? Well a loop is how you tell JavaScript to complete the "control flow" it is a way of saying "Hey, here is the process to do things now do it." and it is also called a loop because you control how many times you want JavaScript to go through the process before stopping. The same way you wouldn't want to just build 1 house if you we're a building company you'd want to loop through the process as many times as you needed until all the houses were built. </p>

        <p>So as you can see in above images there's three sections to how the webpage will look but they all work together to get the
           final output like you can see image the 3rd image which is a simple webpage which should look familar to you as its what we all
           use everyday. 
        </p>
        <p>The first image we can see is our CSS file, the second image is our HTML file and third image is of course the end result on 
           our web browser. In our CSS image we can see that in order to create a class we must start with a period symbol followed by 
           the name you wish to call the class, creating an ID is similar however you use a hashtag symbal followed by the name. Note that
           the names have hyphens and not spaces in the names as CSS and HTML recognise spaces as new words so we must use hyphens when creating names. After 
           you create the name you can put the rules that you want the class or ID to follow. Rules are just another way of saying what 
           the class or ID will do when added to the HTML file. After we have created the classes and IDs we then head over to our HTML 
           page to add them to whatever words or images we want to add them to. In this example I have made the words the same as what 
           classes and IDs I have added to them to make it easier to follow along. We can see in our CSS image that class 1 has a rule 
           of color green and as we have added that class to our words "This is class 1" we can see the words are no green. We can see next
           that class 2 has a rule of underline and because we added that class to our words "This is class 2" they now have a line under them. 
           As we go furhter down our CSS image we can see that ID 1 has the rule colour blue and ID 2 has the rule line-through and these both
           corospond on our webpage after we added them to our HTML file because "This is ID 1" is in the colour blue and "This is ID 2" 
           has a line through the words.
        </p>
        <p>Now you may be asking yourself "Why would I use ID tags when I can just create lots of different classes?" and you'd be asking a 
           very good question. There are a couple of reasons as to why you would want to use an ID instead of a class. The number 1 reason 
           in my opinion is because ID tags overwrite a class tag if they are conflicting. Now you may be thinking "What does that even mean?"
           I'm glad you asked because that brings me to the last two sentences in the web browser image. You can see that the sentence "This is
           class 1 and ID 2" is both green in color and has a line through the words. This is because the rule for class 1 and ID 2 do 
           NOT conflict with each other this is because one is "color" and the other is "text-decoration" as seen in the CSS file. Now if we
           take a look at the sentence "This is class 1 and ID 1" we can see it is only blue in color even though class 1 specifies green.
           This is because class 1 and ID 1 DO conflict with each other as they both have "color" rules and it is blue in color because if
           there is a conflict between a class and an ID tag the ID tag wins. The second reason you would use an ID tag instead of a class tag 
           is because an ID tag is used for very specific and distinct formating as you can only have one ID tag per element/paragraph. It will
           also over rule any class that has been added to an element if they are conflicting.
          </p>
        <p>In conclusion classes and ID tags are very similar but are also both unique in their own ways and provide different aspects of styling. 
           Classes provide flexiblilty and reuseablity when styling a webpage, while IDs are more specfifc and unique when providing style to
           a page, but by utilizing both correctly you can add some great style to whatever page you may be designing.
